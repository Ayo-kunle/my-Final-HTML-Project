    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Hello, my name is Edwards Ayokunle, and I am an electrical design engineer with a bachelor of engineering degree in electrical & electronics engineering. <br> After working in the electrical engineering field for several years, I have decided to make the transition to the tech industry. <br> My experience as an electrical design engineer has equipped me with a strong foundation in electrical principles, project management, and technical problem-solving skills. <br> Now, I'm excited to apply these skills to a new set of challenges in the tech industry.

        <br> As a lifelong learner, I am always seeking to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date on the latest advancements in the field. <br> I am particularly interested in software development, and I have been teaching myself coding languages such as Python and JavaScript in my free time. <br> I am confident that my passion for technology and my strong foundation in electrical engineering make me a valuable asset to any tech team.
        
        <br> In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, traveling, and reading about history and science. <br> Thank you for taking the time to learn a little more about me!</p>
